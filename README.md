# Multitrack Wav File
.mtwav is a file format based on the .wav but holds multiple "tracks" of n channels rather than a single track of n channels. Intended as a means of grouping multiple audio files of the same format together under a uniform timing [0, n-1] where n is the last sample in the timeline. The end of the timeline could be the end of the longest file in the case where all tracks begin at the word clock's [0] or the end of the last playing file in the case the tracks have starting positions a minimum of [n-2] samples from the end of the intended time.
